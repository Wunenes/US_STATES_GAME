This US States game is a simple game using a turtle GUI that allows the user to enter the 50 US states. If the user feels tired or wants to stop just enter q and the unnamed states will be displayes in red. This game is one of the 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu projects leveraging OOP, GUIs like turtle and libraries like pandas.

The main goal of publishing this repository was like a test on my end, like a stepping stone for publishing larger scale projects that interest me on github.
